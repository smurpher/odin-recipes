        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I go to my local Mexican Market and buy "pollo para asar"
             which translates to "chicken to grill." This chicken is
              seasoned and ready to grill. These delicious tacos are 
              easy to make and topped with cilantro and onions. I serve
               them with guacamole, salsa and fresh lime wedges on the side.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pollo para asar (seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until juices run clear and 
                chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F 
                (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball and let rise.</li>
            <li>Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable in the microwave, about 1 minute.
                 Top with chicken, onions, and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
